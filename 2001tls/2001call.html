<FONT SIZE ="-1" FACE="Times, Ariel">The role of agreement in natural language is an issue of current interest and debate in many subfields of linguistics including morphology, syntax, semantics, and language acquisition, and poses a number of empirical and theoretical problems for all frameworks of linguistic theory.  The aim of this conference will be to share research findings and proposals on the role of agreement in relation to a number of current issues in these areas and interface issues between these areas including the role of agreement in morphology and the lexicon, the problem of "dis-agreement" effects, the role of agreement in the theory of clause structure and Universal Grammar, the role of agreement in semantic interpretation, and the role of agreement in language acquisition in relation to these areas.
<BR><BR>
We invite abstracts on original, unpublished work in any of these areas as they relate to the role of agreement in natural language.
