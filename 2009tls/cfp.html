<h2>Call for papers <em>(Now closed)</em></h2>

<p> TLS XII, the 12th annual meeting of the Texas Linguistics Society,
invites proposals from diverse theoretical frameworks in linguistics
and language-related topics from disciplines such as anthropology,
cognitive science, literature, neuroscience, and psychology. The
meeting's general session covers all areas of linguistic
interest. There are, in addition, two concurrent events: one
parasession described below and The 5th Workshop on Discourse
Structure in honor of Carlota S. Smith. The parasession has as its
Approaches to Semantics and Pragmatics Based on Naturally Occurring
Data, Elicitation, and Papers exploring classic issues in theoretical
semantics and pragmatics based on psycholinguistic experiments and on
methods such as questionnaires, elicitation tests, corpus studies,
follow-up studies, and interviews, as well as submissions that
introduce new data from understudied languages, are welcome. The 5th
Workshop on Discourse Structure in honor of Carlota S. Smith will
focus on two areas of research in which Professor Smith did much
pioneering work: the semantics of temporal location, tense, and
aspect, and research into modes of discourse. Talks for this workshop
are by invitation, but abstracts dealing with this conference theme
are welcome for the general session. </p>
